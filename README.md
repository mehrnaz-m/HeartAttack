# Heart Attack Prediction Analysis using Machine Learning
## Introduction
This project aims to predict the risk of heart attacks using machine learning techniques. It utilizes patient data and applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree algorithms to build predictive models.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python and the required libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib).
2. Download the Jupyter Notebook file (heart_attack_prediction.ipynb) from this repository.
3. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab).
4. Follow the instructions and execute the code cells to run the analysis and build the predictive models.

## Results
The optimized Logistic Regression model achieved an 86% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities. Additional details about the performance of each algorithm are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or would like to add new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
